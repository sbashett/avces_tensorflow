Deep Predictive models for collision risk assessment in autonomous driving
[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10453.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10453.pdf)

I have refurbished and improved codebase for collision risk assessment in autonomous driving based on deep predictive models. Please follow this [gitlab link](https://gitlab.com/avces/avces_tensorflow/tree/master) for the actual repository and further details.
